I am a data journalist at CNBC, where I perform analysis, create graphics, and write stories for cnbc.com. I work across all of our site's business news coverage, from markets and investing to politics and entertainment. 

You can see my work on my CNBC author page ([https://www.cnbc.com/nate-rattner/](https://www.cnbc.com/nate-rattner/)) as well as in many of our web stories and newsletters.
